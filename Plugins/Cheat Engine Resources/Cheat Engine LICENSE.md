Closest thing to a CE "License" from this comment on Feb 24, 2019
from the author of Cheat Engine, Dark Byte:

```
I need a license that:
allows use of this sourcecode for private purpose only, without allowing spread of binaries to the public. (no public bastardized CE builds/ports, like UCE's, but you're free to make them for yourself and a handful of friends, but not a full website dedicated to your CE build/branch)
((Sourcecode is always allowed to be shared))

Also disallow selling of CE binaries, with the exception when packaged inside a trainer generated by CE (That means Tiny and Gigantic trainers can be sold if you wish)
Tables generated by CE are the full ownership of the person who created it (like the perl license) so can also be sold

So not one of the default licenses
```
